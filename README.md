# David Dong's Personal Website
## By DavidD-Fleming

Heya! This is my personal website which I created using HTML, CSS, and Javascipt using Github pages. The point of this website was to teach myself some of these languages, familiarize myself with web development, and to show off my past projects!

That's all!
