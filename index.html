    <h1>Hey! I'm David Dong.</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center;">I'm a Rutgers University student majoring in Computer Science and Physics and this is my website! <br>
    It is still <strong>very</strong> under production so excuse its appearance as I try to teach myself html, css, and javascript. For now, I am working on just figuring out a good template to display the website while creating a second page so I can chronicle my past projects in more depth. <br>
    The aforementioned second page (also under production): <a href="projects.html">Projects!</a>
