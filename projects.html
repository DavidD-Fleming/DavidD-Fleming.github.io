    <p style="text-align: center;">Unfortunately, while there are quite are few projects I would love to show off, a few of them were lost over the years since I didn't know VCS were even a thing back then. Some of these projects include a currency exchanger, a discord bot, a pet care simulator, and etc. No point in crying over spilled milk though and let's get into the projects I can show off! </p>
