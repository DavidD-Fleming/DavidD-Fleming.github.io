      <h1>Developer's Page</h1>
      <p style="text-align: center;"> Welcome to David Dong's developer's page! Here, I will account all my previous personal projects. I will go over the software/languages/libraries/etc that I used on these projects and give a short description of what they do. I will also go a little bit in depth about what I learned, what I struggled with, what I liked about the project, and what I would do if I were to come back to the project. I hope you enjoy! </p>

      <h2>Pokemon Decoy (High School)</h2>

      <p2> Pokemon decoy was a project I worked on while in high school and was the enterprise that made me want to pursue computer science. The game was built in HTML, CSS, and Javascript and mimics the combat in Pokemon. Players would take turns casting their abilities and the first player whose health bar goes to 0 loses. This project is not optimal at all and misses features like telling players how to actually use their abilities (QWER for triangle abilities and AS for attempted pentagon). Otherwise, I still remember this project fondly due to its sheer attention to detail such as the health bar of players shaking when damaged and buttons flashing when pressed. The website also has a feature that allows it to be played in Japanese. I believe the website is still running and, if it is, you can access it <a href="https://narrowsilkycgi--daviddong1.repl.co/"> here </a>. </p1>
